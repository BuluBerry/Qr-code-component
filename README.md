## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

It's been a few months since i've done any coding, so this was just a great project to get my brain working again. I'm not too familiar with "transform" so I had to do a bit of problem solving to get the conainer in the exact center of the screen. 

```css
.container{
    width: 320px;
    height: 497px;
    background-color: white;
    position: fixed;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    text-align: center;
    border-radius: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

I need to work on easily moving stuff around the screen to the exact location I want them, either using "transfom", "flex", or "grid". 

### Useful resources

- stack Overflow [https://stackoverflow.com/] is one of my favorite places to go if I need to trouble shoot a problem, or if I just can't figures out what I need to add.
